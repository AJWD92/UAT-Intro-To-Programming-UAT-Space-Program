# UAT Intro To Programming 

## UAT Space Program

A repo to turn in my UAT Introduction to programming assignments over the course of 5 weeks

each folder is labeld to represent that week and it's MVP.

As the class progress over the following weeks to come. I will have folders that correspond with each week’s assignment. The code in each folder will be a build on from the code in the previous week’s assignment.
